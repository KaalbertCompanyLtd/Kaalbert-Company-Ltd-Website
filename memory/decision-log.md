# Decision Log

## 2026-09-04

Project initialized.

Summary:
Initial project structure created. Full planning pipeline (Phases 1–7 of
`PROJECT_PLANNING_FRAMEWORK.md`) completed before any implementation began, including a
dedicated pre-Phase-6 audit pass that found and closed 7 requirements/consistency gaps
(see `docs/dashboard.md`) before task planning was written.

Two engineering-authority decisions made during Phase 6 task planning, closing items each
feature doc had explicitly deferred to "Phase 6 task planning" rather than left silently
unresolved:

Summary:

- Attribution retention window set to 90 days (`docs/tasks/05-landing-and-measurement.md`,
  T5.4), matching GA4/Meta's own standard attribution lookback.
- Admin session policy set to 30 minutes inactivity / 12 hours absolute
  (`docs/tasks/06-admin-auth.md`, T6.3), matching Document 13.03 §10's confidentiality bar.

T1.1 implementation decisions, made while scaffolding the repo/app/deploy pipeline.

Summary:

- **Repo root confirmed as `Website Build/`**, not its parent folder — the sibling
  `Company Docs`/`Planning framework and trigger`/`Vendor Response` folders are business/
  admin material with no reason to ever reach GitHub, even privately.
- **Next.js 16.3.4** (latest stable at the time, not an older pinned major) — chosen since
  this is a greenfield scaffold with no prior version commitment. Two Next.js 16 behaviour
  changes recorded directly in CLAUDE.md's Auth Pattern section since they'll bite future
  tasks otherwise: `middleware.ts` is deprecated in favour of `app/proxy.ts` (Node runtime,
  not Edge — relevant to Milestone 6 admin-session enforcement), and plain `tsc --noEmit`
  fails on a fresh checkout because typed-route ambient types
  (e.g. `LayoutProps<'/'>`) don't exist until `next typegen` runs — so `npm run typecheck`
  is `next typegen && tsc --noEmit`, never bare `tsc`.
- **ESLint pinned to `^9`, not the newly-released `^10`** — bumping produced
  `ERESOLVE overriding peer dependency` warnings against `eslint-config-next@16.3.4`'s
  plugin chain; `create-next-app`'s own generated `package.json` (same Next.js version)
  independently chose `^9`, so matched that rather than force an unproven combo. `eslint@9`
  is flagged EOL/"no longer supported" by npm — see `memory/technical-debt.md`, revisit once
  `eslint-config-next` bumps its tested peer range.
- **Prettier run across the entire pre-existing docs/ui/memory tree**, not just new files —
  T1.1 is explicitly where "ESLint + Prettier must both be configured and passing from this
  task's first commit onward" (CLAUDE.md Coding Standards) becomes real; every file had to
  reach compliance, not just this task's own diff. Verified the diff was cosmetic only
  (emphasis-marker style, blank-line-after-heading) on a sample file before running
  tree-wide.
- **Cloudflare/domain step deferred** — `kaalbert.com` is not registered (WHOIS: no match),
  so Cloudflare has no zone to front. User chose to finish everything else and log this as a
  known blocker rather than register a placeholder domain. See `memory/technical-debt.md`.
- **Railway provisioned under a new company account** (kaalbert.company@gmail.com), not the
  personal account the CLI was originally logged into — user deliberately created a separate
  company Railway account first. Initial deploy done via `railway up` (CLI upload) to prove
  the pipeline works; GitHub-connected auto-deploy (the actual "main deploys automatically on
  push" AC) is wired via `railway service source connect` but requires a `main` branch to
  exist on GitHub first — blocked on the first push. See `memory/technical-debt.md`.
- **Two GitHub remotes**: `origin` →
  `KaalbertCompanyLtd/Kaalbert-Company-Ltd-Website` (authoritative — Railway auto-deploy and
  all CI point here) and `personal` →
  `cosbyDeveloper/Kaalbert-Company-Ltd-Website` (push-only, for the user's own contribution
  graph — not a second source of truth). `github` MCP server added to `.mcp.json`,
  referencing `${KAALBERT_GITHUB_TOKEN}` (the user's own env var name, sourced from
  `~/.secrets` via `~/.bashrc`) rather than CLAUDE.md's example `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  name — same pattern, actual variable name kept as the user set it up.
